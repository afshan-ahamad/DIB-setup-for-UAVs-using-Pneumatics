A drone is an unmanned aircraft. Drones are more formally known as unmanned aerial 
vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft systems. Essentially, a drone is a flying robot that 
can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously using software-controlled flight plans in 
its embedded systems, that work in conjunction with onboard sensors and a global 
positioning system (GPS). UAVs were most often associated with the military. They were 
initially used for anti-aircraft target practice, intelligence gathering and, more 
controversially, as weapons platforms. Drones are now also used in a range of civilian 
roles, search and rescue, surveillance, traffic monitoring, weather monitoring, 
firefighting, personal use, drone-based photography, videography, agriculture as well as 
for delivery services. etc...
